# Demo2013
This is a duplicate demo from WWDC 2013 Session 217 Exploring Scroll Views in iOS 7.

At first, the session presents how to make nested scroll views working together by using a `UICollectionView` in `UIScrollView`, while each `UICollectionViewCell` has a `UIScrollView` as the subview.
Meanwhil, the `UICollectionView` is the subclass of `UIScrollView`.

The demo code has been published in the [1st release](https://github.com/antonio081014/Demo2013/releases/tag/V1.0)

In the second part, the session presents how to add special animation effect in the `UICollectionView` by customizing `UICollectionFlowLayout` with adding `UIDynamicBehavior` to `UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes`.

The demo code has been published in the [2nd release](https://github.com/antonio081014/Demo2013/releases/tag/V2.0)

Hope someone could help me make a gif file and add it here for the better demo purpose.
